# SporeBG
Spore BoardGame
## How It Works
Two players alternate in having the right to move, but the unique aspect of SporeBG is that the right to move is not just to take a single action, but each piece can act independently by moving one step at a time.

The method of determining "a piece" is the same as in Go, whether there is a connection up, down, left, or right.
